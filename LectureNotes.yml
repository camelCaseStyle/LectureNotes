- Week 3 
  - Understand the workflow 
  - Reading the dataset into python 
  - Descriptive statistics 
  - Distributions of data columns 
      - ordered 
      - unordered 
  CRISP-DM Methodology 
  - Tries to describe what we do in data science in a business context 
      - Good to read up on it and understand the CRISPDM methodology 
          - Understand the context of a data science project (Why are you doing this?)
              - Motivation is business question
          - We then find the data 
              - Finding suitable data can be very challenging 
          - Data preparation 
          - Modelling 
          - Evaluation of the model 
          - At this stage you could 
              - Ask another question or 
              - Deploy your model into use 
          - You may be asked about the cycle or bits about the cycle 
  - Privacy 
      - Discover structure from large amounts of data 
      - You could draw some solid inferences from the data 
      - Also true inside an organisation not just open government data 
  - Correlation and causation 
      - No link between the two
      - Just because the number of conferences around COVID lowered when case numbers dropped, does not imply that more press conferences = more COVID cases 
      - To explore if their is infact a relation, you would perform a test and then make observations 

- Week 4 Visualisation 
  - Understood the importance of having good graphs 
  - Using seaborn 
  - Talked about outliers
      - Deciding whether or not to keep the outliers 
- Week 5 Predictive modelling 
  - Linear regression 
  - Logistic regression - Easy way to predict categorical outcomes
  - The above 2 models are the most important models in Data Science. These are simple models and are explainable models 
  - Confusion matrix?
  - The concept of training and testing data was introduced. This is fundamental part of ML and Data Science 
  - Understand overfitting vs underfitting?
  - Random selection of data from the sample population 
- Week 6 
  - Discussion around software engineering practices and data science 
  - Is it really a good way to write code in a jupyter notebook?
    - Many problems with the notebook format 
    - Really its important to understand the concerns 
    - Can you write tests to test your data?
    - What is MSE and RSE?
    - What is normalisation and how would you normalise the data?
- Week 7
  - Learned two types of learning 
    - Supervised - Instances are labelled 
      - Regression 
      - Classification 
      - What is the difference between the two?
        - Depends on label type 
          - Is label continous - Regression 
          - Label is discrete - Classification problem 
    - Unsupervised - Instances are not labelled
      - The only model we studied was clustering 
    - Clustering 
      - KMeans 
        - How the K means algo works?
        - The steps
          - How are centroids updated?
            - Compute the centroid 
              - Select randomly 
              - Cluster (assign points closest to centroid)
                - Centroid calculation: (Sum(x)/Number of points, Sum(y)/Number of points)
              - Can we pick a better centroid?
                - Yes? Then keep going 
                - No? Stop. You are done
        - We have to normalise the dataset as different units can be of different size 
          - We could normalise by: (Parameter - mean of parameter)/Standard deviation of parameter
          - This makes it a gaussian distribution
        - How to pick K?
          - Could use the elbow method
          - If K is small then model is underfitting 
          - If K is large model is overfitting  
      - Heirarchical 
        - Bottom up learning process 
        - Join 2 closes points - this is cluster 1 
        - Then join one more point which is closest to this cluster 
        - How to define the distance between the 2 cluster  
          - Closet point (single linkage)
            - Distance of two cluster is measured as distance between 2 closest points in the clusters
          - Complete linkage 
            - Furthest two points in 2 clusters 
          - Average linkage
            - Measure distance between all points and measure average 
          - Centroid linkage 
            - Compute distance between centroids 
          - How to chose number of clusters?
            - Use dendogram 
            - Draw a horizontal line to draw number of clusters 
            - The number of intersections = number of clusters
